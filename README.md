# GOALS

MONDAY
THE 3 MAIN AIMS I have for this first day of independent learning are as follows:

repeat the github add/commit/push cycle in terminal so that it doesn't feel more comfortable to always fall back on the GUI. if you are reading this via github it worked (party emoji)

think about career goals and try to get a more concrete idea of what it is I want to work toward vs the nebulous goals I have in my head

re-read all the notes I took today and ask for clarification on any point I do not fully understand or feel like I could explain to someone who did not attend the class today

RE:CAREER GOALS
the main aspects I would like to focus on for my career are: creatively fulfilling / challenging/engaging and something that I can do freelance, in order to give me more control over my hours and chosen projects (in an ideal world)
Reading more about web develpment, since the role I know most about is front-end development, I can imagine myself designing a website and a brand packet ... I would love to be able to say I am then able to create the website, front AND back end. Right now my focus would be on small ecommerce sites eg the people I work with at craft fairs/something that would call for strong senses of personality in the designs, not just relying on template-hosting websites

https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-type-of-developer-am-i-quiz/ quiz (for what it's worth) also suggests a frontend developer, but the experience of foricbly having to pick one aspect I am excited about in the creation of a website made me realise that it's not just ONE aspect I am excited about. It's being able to create things from beginning to end

QUESTIONS ON NOTES?

- although I know it wasn't needed, was the solution I found on a forum (no jekyll) the correct step for not showing the README as the webpage in our workshop task
- following up on the point about a github filled with half-finished/broken projects is more valuable than one with one "good" project, if you are the sort of person who finds tutorials helpful for learning, is that something that should be kept on github, or something like codepen? is it all good if you credit/link the tutorial in the README file?


DAY 2

this day was an introduction to CSS (which I already had done before, but didn't have the understanding behind it) and styling a news page. Throughout the day I have also been working on making a fun little quiz to test myself in order to make sure I have been taking in what has been said (alongside the workshop tasks). 

I have a better understanding of classes/styling now. Originally I had just been giving HTML items literally any old random code, for example "<ad>" because I wanted that one line of text to be red, but after conversations and a workshop on div/classes, I instead included it in the sidebar class and made sure that the rules of inheritance made the styling make sense/work. 

For this self-reflection hour I am going to look at examples of coding challenges for entry-level positions. I know they will be beyond what I could complete at the moment, but I want get rid of the idea in my head that these positions are something I will never be able to reach for (imposter syndrome leakage again) and allow my brain to instead latch onto more solid and better imagined skill goals. You have to know what you don't know... you know?
